[00:00.09] This is the VOA Special English Agriculture Report. 
[00:05.37] Suppose you eat rice every day. 
[00:08.32] But one day you go to the store and discover that the price is more than you can pay. 
[00:15.35] That happened to millions of people two years ago at the height of the world food crisis. 
[00:22.84] Between April of two thousand seven and March of two thousand eight the price of rice doubled in many places. 
[00:32.71] Economists blamed the crisis on different causes, including high energy costs, bad weather and the use of food-crop lands for biofuel production. 
[00:46.54] High food prices pushed more people in developing countries into poverty and hunger. 
[00:54.17] Some researchers say people living in cities in West Africa may have suffered most of all. 
[01:02.82] Geographers from three American colleges did a study that will appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
[01:13.39] William Moseley of Macalester College in Minnesota led the study. 
[01:19.50] The team looked at thirty years' worth of information on food security and agricultural policy in Gambia, Ivory Coast and Mali. 
[01:32.48] Most of the research centered on rice, an important crop in those three West African countries. 
[01:40.06] The researchers say Gambia and Ivory Coast suffered more during the food crisis than Mali did. 
[01:50.72] They say this was because people in Gambia and Ivory Coast had come to depend on imported rice. 
[02:00.19] Local rice production fell after the countries reduced farm supports and import taxes under free market reforms. 
[02:11.51] That meant rice farmers were not only earning less but facing greater competition from imports. 
[02:21.29] Then, when the food crisis hit, the cost of foreign rice shot up. 
[02:27.25] The researchers say Mali suffered less because it depended less on imported rice, in part because of geography. 
[02:39.59] Mali is not a coastal country with ports like Ivory Coast and Gambia. 
[02:47.47] Laurence Becker from Oregon State University says after gaining independence, African nations tried to help farmers. 
[02:58.71] Governments provided low-cost seeds and fertilizers. 
[03:03.94] They built processing mills and roads to market. 
[03:08.32] And they protected their markets with high tariffs on imported food. 
[03:14.15] But by the late nineteen seventies and the nineteen eighties, those countries no longer had much money to help farmers. 
[03:23.00] So they changed policies and tried another way to improve agriculture. 
[03:29.21] Governments and major lenders like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund turned to free market policies. 
[03:39.06] We'll talk more next week about how the researchers link that change to the effects of the recent food crisis. 
[03:47.93] And that's the VOA Special English Agriculture Report, written by Jerilyn Watson.
